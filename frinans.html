        <!-- Problem -->
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>During my walks of life, I have seen many people in my circle struggle in managing their finances. Most schools usually do not equip us with the basics of money management such as budgeting, saving, debt, investing, and more.
          <br>I wanted to rethink the way people could make wise financial choices for everyday living — while at the same time avoiding mistakes that will lead to lifelong money struggles, and eventually building healthy financial habits. So as part
          of my UX Design study, I decided to design a solution and tackle this problem.
        </p>

        <!-- Solution -->
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>My solution was an app called Frinans that helps young adults simplify their finances by providing a platform to handle their money by monitoring budgets, saving more to reach financial goals, and taking control of their financial life.

          <!-- Research context text-->
          <p>I began researching my potential users through surveys and user interviews to gain a better understanding of users’ motivation and behavior around budgeting, on the context in which users would need and use a budgeting app, and learn
            more about the user's pain points in interacting with the existing budgeting app.

          <p>I surveyed 38 people regarding their behavior on personal finance management, also their experience and pain points in using other money management apps. Here are my main findings:

        <div>
          <p>After collecting initial survey information, I interviewed 4 people to dig deeper into their finance management habits. Here are some of the main insights I gathered.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><span>Categorization.</span> All interview participants faced frustrations when it comes to the wrong categorization e.g. when someone buys stocks for investment, the app categorizes it as an expense instead of investment. Most of them also would like to be able to set customized categories.</li>
              <li><span>Data visualization.</span> Presenting visualization of the user’s financial data and progress into bar graphs or pie charts is found to be very helpful by all participants.</li>
              <li><span>Family account.<span> People who live or share expenses together would like to be able to monitor their expenses in one place, so they can track e.g., who has paid which bill or expense, or how much that person has paid.</li>
              <li><span>One-stop service.</span> Participants want a one-stop service where they get the aforementioned wants & needs in one place, without having to open another tab or app.</li>
              <li><span>Bill payment tracker.</span> Participants want to be reminded about their obligations (bills & subscriptions), and also receive suggestions on which subscriptions they can skip to save more money.</li>
